<p class="admonition-title">What is TomoChain?</p>
<p>TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms.
TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.</p>
<p>TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture.
It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What problem is TomoChain aiming to solve?</p>
<p>The problems that TomoChain aims to solve can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time)</li>
<li>High transaction fees on Ethereum</li>
<li>Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting and supply-chain management.
Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era.
In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services.
Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively.
Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>TomoChain is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions.
Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. </p>
<p>TomoChain supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
TomoChain can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS) and once sharding is enabled, TomoChain is expected to reach 20'000-30'000 TPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does TomoChain work? What is the architecture and consensus used?</p>
<p>TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low fees (appro. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can you tell more about Proof of Stake Voting (PoSV)? What is it?</p>
<p>At the heart of TomoChain, the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus enables TomoChain as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation.</p>
<p>PoSV features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 50k $TOMO to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders.
The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch.
Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement.
A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes.
At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded.
Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is Double Validation?</p>
<p>Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization.
Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain.
Double validation strengthens Tomochain’s security, reduces fork and nothing-at-stake attacks, and makes TomoChain unique among other Proof-of-Stake-based blockchains.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is an 'epoch'?</p>
<p>An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or 30 minutes).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which scaling solutions will TomoChain implement? Will you have sharding?</p>
<p>TomoChain solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Proof-of-stake Voting (POSV) consensus protocol.
We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation.</p>
<p>To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our <a href="https://bit.ly/2xHK0u3">Sharding proposal</a> for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus.
The implementation of sharding is on-going and we will enable it in Q2 2019, after TomoChain decentralized exchange (TomoX) launch.</p>
<p>Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma.
New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into TomoChain's masternode architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed?</p>
<p>TomoChain supports low transaction fees (appro. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
The mainnet with POSV Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS).
Once sharding is implemented by Q2 2019, we expect 20'000-30'000 TPS.</p>
<p>TomoChain team is continuously researching other scaling techniques to keep improving.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What makes TomoChain different?</p>
<p>The unique point of TomoChain comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Novel technology:</strong> includes</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of Stake Voting consensus</li>
<li>Build in governance D-app</li>
<li>Double Validation and Randomization</li>
<li>Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture</li>
</ul>
<p>This enables TomoChain to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap transactions: appro. 1/100 of that of Ethereum</li>
<li>2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem; TPS will be dramatically higher once our sharding solution is enabled (20k-30k TPS)</li>
<li>2 second block time for fast transactions</li>
<li>EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our unique products</strong></p>

<li>TomoScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information</li>
<li>TomoMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; to vote for Masternodes and shows Masternode performance statistics</li>
<li>TomoWallet: Securely store, send, receive TOMO and other tokens issued on TomoChain; Allows users to vote and track rewards</li>
<li>TomoX: A secure and efficient relayer-masternode decentralized exchange protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our own ecosystem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TomoChain also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability, tourism etc such as TechInAsia, Kambria, Axie Infinity, Vnext, Farmatrust, TE-Food, Triip Protocol, Portal Network...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does TomoChain compare with other available blockchain projects?</p>
<p>Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk.
We are doing a series of Medium posts on this matter.</p>
<p>A post named <a href="https://medium.com/tomochain/blockchain-comparison-overview-eos-io-casper-ffg-cardano-tendermint-and-tomochain-2b0df68806b6">"Blockchain comparison overview: EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint and Tomochain"</a> has been published.
A detailed comparison with EOS, <a href="https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-vs-eos-io-the-battle-of-posv-vs-dpos-or-just-some-coincidence-of-design-philosophy-b5f606a1e5df">Tomochain vs. EOS.IO: The battle of PoSV vs. DPoS or just some coincidence of design philosophy?</a>, has been published too.

<p>The world is a pretty big place, and startups often kills themself because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition.
At the moment, besides the core TomoChain platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference.
Quality before quantity.</p>
<p>Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently.
The solution is also very unique to TomoChain's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time.</p>
<p>There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with Tomochain's overall design.
These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make Tomochain very unique compared to other big projects.
We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which blockchain(s) are TomoChain's main competitors?</p>
<p>On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, TomoChain etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on.
On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete.</p>
<p>TomoChain has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">TomoChain is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?</p>
<p>EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine.
TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to TomoChain.
Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to TomoChain.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is TomoChain a side-chain of Ethereum?</p>
<p>TomoChain has its own blockchain since TomoChain Mainnet was launched in December 14th, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is TomoChain compatible with Ethereum?</p>
<p>Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to TomoChain.
This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and TomoChain in one single dApp?</p>
<p>Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and TomoChain.
It can be done relatively easy since TomoChain supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">When is TomoChain mainnet launch?</p>
<p>TomoChain Mainnet was launched on December 14th, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the difference between TOMO and TomoChain?</p>
<p>TOMO is the native currency of the TomoChain ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do you solve 'security problems' when using TomoChain?</p>
<p>In terms of security of consensus protocol, TomoChain proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system.
The details of these techniques can be referred in our <a href="https://tomochain.com/docs/technical-whitepaper--1.0.pdf">Technical paper</a>.</p>
<p>TomoChain solves some consensus-related security aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. TomoChain solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization.
    The details are shown in our technical paper.</li>
<li>Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block.
    Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain.
    TomoChain addresses by providing finality.
    Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected.</li>
<li>Censorship-resistance: Please <a href="https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-vs-eos-io-the-battle-of-posv-vs-dpos-or-just-some-coincidence-of-design-philosophy-b5f606a1e5df">refer to this medium article</a> for more detailed analysis</li>
<li>DDoS and spamming attacks: TomoChain's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of TOMO in order to flood the network for only a short time.</li>

<p class="admonition-title">Where can I take a look at TomoChain code? Is there a GitHub repository?</p>
<p>All the code regarding TomoChain is free to consult on our <a href="https://github.com/tomochain">GitHub</a>.
This includes the code for the TomoChain blockchain client, governance DApp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc.</p>
<p>However, other blockchain related projects like ReplyBlock or drafts, work-in-progress and not yet disclosed projects are usually kept in private repositories.</p>
<p>We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase.
Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale.
It might change in the future.</p>
<p>We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What incentives have partners and dApp developers to build on TomoChain?</p>
<p>TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to TomoChain.</p>
<p>Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to TomoChain, instantly enjoying all TomoChain advantages: almost zero-transaction fee; 2-second confirmation time; 2'000 TPS and soon 20K-30K TPS once sharding is enabled.</p>
<p>D-app developers also have dedicated technical support from TomoChain developers.</p>
<p>Besides the technical aspects, our partners will also benefit from the TomoChain community support and fundraising opportunities, thanks to TomoChain very good relationships with well-known investors.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What is TOMO? Can you describe the functions and purposes of TOMO?</p>
<p>TOMO is the native cryptocurrency of TomoChain and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on TomoChain.
Being the protocol token for the TomoChain infrastructure, TOMO will be needed by all parties utilising TomoChain to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps.</p>
<p>The supply of TOMO is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, TOMO is an integral part of the TomoChain network for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>TOMO will be used to fund the development of TomoChain and its ecosystem (TomoScan, TomoMater, TomoWallet, etc.).</li>
<li>TOMO will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the TomoChain engine/ecosystem.</li>
<li>TOMO will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the TomoChain network.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check our <a href="https://docs.tomochain.com/wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/">technical whitepaper</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I mine TOMO?</p>
<p>TOMO is not <code>mineable</code> but <code>mintable</code> by masternodes.
Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch.
Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is TOMO circulating supply and total supply?</p>
<p>The initial circulating supply at genesis block is 55'000'000 but the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch.</p>
<p>After 8 years, TOMO total supply is fixed at 100'000'000 TOMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How is TOMO distributed?</p>
<p>The token allocation is splitted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>55 millions TOMO was already allocated after the token sale period;</li>
<li>12 millions TOMO are reserved for the team vested over the next 4 years;</li>
<li>16 millions TOMO are reserved for strategic partners and an ecosystem building fund;</li>
<li>17 millions TOMO are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years</li>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Will TomoChain have inflation?</p>
<p>The total supply is fixed at 100 million TOMO in the first 8 years (non-inflationary).
17 million TOMO which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years.
At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees.
But the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million TOMO per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How often are block rewards paid out?</p>
<p>Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes).
Stakers will be also rewarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">If TomoChain has zero fees, how can Masternodes get rewards?</p>
<p>The block rewards will be emitted from a reserved fund with 17 million TOMO for the first 8 years.
The block rewards are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st and 2nd year: 4 million TOMO annually</li>
<li>3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million TOMO annually</li>
<li>6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million TOMO annually</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well.</p>
<p>After 8 years, the block rewards will come from the exchange fees.

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Does TomoChain have Masternodes? How do they work?</p>
<p>Yes, TomoChain has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation.
Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in TomoChain’s platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masternode Candidates:</strong> Any account can deposit 50,000 TOMO using <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a> to become a masternode candidate.
A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Becoming a Masternode:</strong> A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch.
A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs.
Masternodes will also receive fees from the TomoChain DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>TomoChain masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is a masternode in the TomoChain ecosystem?</p>
<p>A TomoChain masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network.
Its job is to create and sign blocks.
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of TOMO.</p>
<p>Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What are the incentives to run a masternode?</p>
<p>Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure.
However, masternode owners need to invest in TomoChain by depositing at least 50'000 TOMO, and stake them in the long term.</p>
<p>After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards.
Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support TomoChain to get into top 150 most voted candidates.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99?</p>
<p>The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration.
In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99.
The more important consideration is the scalability.
We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later.</p>
<p>Also 150 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s Number</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX?</p>
<p>The block rewards will come from a 17 million TOMO reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block.
Our <a href="https://docs.tomochain.com/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> lays out the number in detail.</p>
<p>And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">When are Masternode rewards paid out?</p>
<p>Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch.
An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How much rewards will Masternodes receive?</p>
<p>Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 TOMO in the first two years.
This amount of 250 TOMO will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch.</p>
<p>Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 TOMO. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 TOMO per epoch.</p>
<p>Please, refer to our <a href="https://docs.tomochain.com/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> for more details about the masternodes reward.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters?</p>
<p>There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders.
The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Reward:</strong> The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator.</li>
<li><strong>Staking Reward:</strong> The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake.
The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K TOMO initial deposit.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation Reward:</strong> The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the TomoChain company initially. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers?</p>
<p>The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode.
The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards.</p>
<p>Please, refer to our <a href="https://docs.tomochain.com/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> for more details about the masternodes reward.
We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes.</p>
<p>One example is outlined below.</p>
<p>Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked).</p>
<p>Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 0.6667 Tomo</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K Tomo staked = 0.00625 Tomo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate reward achieved per week:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 224 Tomo</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K Tomo staked = 2.1 Tomo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate reward achieved per year:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 11,680 Tomo</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K Tomo staked = 109.5 Tomo (10.95% annually)</code></li>
<li><code>Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K Tomo deposit: 17,155 Tomo (34.31% annually)</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode?</p>
<p>A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K TOMO and is listed on <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a>.</p>
<p>One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch.
Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How can I become a Masternode?</p>
<p>The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate.
To become a Masternode Candidate you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to run TomoChain software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements</li>
<li>to deposit 50’000 TOMO in a smart-contract via TomoMaster</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a>.
The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Do I need to use my own computer to run a node?</p>
<p>We recommend using an IaaS ("cloud") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc).
The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime.</p>
<p>If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our <a href="https://gitter.im/tomochain">Gitter</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which are the hardware requirements to run a node?</p>
<p>Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound.
Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT)</li>
<li>16 cores CPU</li>
<li>32GB of RAM</li>
<li>SSD storage</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%.
Those servers would be a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DigitalOcean:</strong> CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU</li>
<li><strong>Amazon EC2:</strong> C5 instance</li>
<li><strong>Google Cloud Engine:</strong> n1-highcpu-16</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes?</p>
<p>Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of TomoChain community in the form of votes.
The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode.
This list will change dynamically every epoch.
Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of TOMO. </p>

<p class="admonition-title">Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode?</p>
<p>It is recommended for security reasons.
You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them.
One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the 'coinbase address'?</p>
<p>'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system.</p>
<p>We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes.
The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees.
The private address is from where you make the initial 50K TOMO deposit and where the block rewards will be collected.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with TomoWallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options?</p>
<p>You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address.
This wallet does not need to contain any TOMO, think of it as a shell address.
You will then stake tomo into the masternode address via your main TOMO wallet.</p>
<p>You can use the iOS and Android apps.
Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://wallet.testnet.tomochain.com">https://wallet.testnet.tomochain.com</a> to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic?</p>
<p>It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation.</p>
<p>The block rewards are sent to the account connected to TomoMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node?</p>
<p>No.
Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses.
But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'?</p>
<p>A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch.</p>
<p>Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct TomoChain software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner.</p>
<p>A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs.
At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list.</p>

After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50’000 TOMO deposit.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized?</p>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What if I do not have enough TOMO for a masternode? Can I stake my coins?</p>
<p>Yes.
Token holders can stake TOMO and receive rewards.</p>
<p>To stake TOMO you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending TOMO to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: TomoMaster.`
The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes.
Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 48 hours (8,640 blocks) after the un-voting.</p>
<p>Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees.
Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards.</p>

</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does TomoChain Masternode Election work (POSV)?</p>
<p>All token holders can vote TOMO on any candidates via <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a>, where they can find a list of all masternode candidates.
To vote, they must deposit TOMO in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate.</p>
<p>The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards.
All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards proportional to the amount of TOMO voted.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I vote?</p>
<p>Any token holder can vote.
Login to TomoMaster and then click 'Vote' on a node.

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I vote from my Ledger Nano S?</p>
<p>Plug in your Ledger and open the Ethereum App. Go to TomoMaster.</p>
<p>Login in the top-right corner and select Ledger from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Change the HD path to <code>m/44'/60'/0'</code></p>
<p>You should see your tomo balance.</p>

<p>Yes, you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes?</p>
<p>TomoMaster doesn't directly support Trezor yet.
So it depends on Metamask.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I connect Trezor to Metamask; after that unlock TomoMaster with Metamask?</p>
<p>This is not supported yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for?</p>
<p>The most important criteria to maximize voter’s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top-150 most voted:</strong> Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware, Performance:</strong> Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards</li>
<li><strong>Number of signed blocks:</strong> The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards</li>
<li><strong>Time of last signed block:</strong> Verify that the masternode is active</li>
<li><strong>Total Capacity:</strong> Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode.</li>
<li><strong>Social Proof, Reputation:</strong> Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for?</p>
<p>You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your TOMO.</p>
<p>Example: If you have 1'000 TOMO you can vote 500 TOMO for candidate A, 450 TOMO for candidate B, and 50 TOMO for candidate C.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the minimum amount to Stake?</p>
<p>The minimum amount to stake is 10 TOMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote?</p>
<p>You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask.
You can also directly connect to the TomoChain Mainnet with Ledger and vote on <a href="https://master.tomochain.com/">TomoMaster</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is it possible to re-invest the TOMO earned and use it to continue voting?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically?</p>
<p>This is not supported currently.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my TOMO back?</p>
<p>Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 48h lock-up period.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I UnVote?</p>
<p>If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the ‘Unvote’ button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of TOMO you wish to unvote.</p>
<p>After unvoting, your TOMO are still locked in the smart contract for 48 hours (96 epochs) before you are able to withdraw.
When the lockup period is finished you need to click the ‘Withdraw’ button and the coins will appear again on your wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How to withdraw after unvoting?</p>
<p>After unvoting, you need to wait until your TOMO is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs or 48 hours).
Then you can go to TomoMaster and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your TOMO.</p>
<p>Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously.</p>

<p>TomoChain's philosophy on decentralized exchanges is quite different from others.
In TomoChain's design for decentralized exchanges, TomoX is the core decentralized exchange protocol, which takes in charge the order matching and execution.
TomoX is integrated into the core layer of the TomoChain consensus. </p>
<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) in TomoChain's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying TomoX protocol.
Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from TomoX which processes these trade orders. </p>
<p>TomoDEX will be the first relayer in TomoChain's decentralized exchange ecosystem.
We expect TomoDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use TomoDex.
TomoDex will be the first to list any token running on top of TomoChain together with well-known cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, and have the best liquidity for new TomoChain's tokens.</p>
<p>With TomoChain almost zero-fee, 2-second confirmation and 2'000 transactions per second, all relayers interacting with TomoX Protocol will be fully decentralized and very efficient.</p>
